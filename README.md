NestJS Interview Challenge
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Carefully review the provided codebase.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Implement full CRUD functionality for Cities and Countries APIs, adhering strictly to the existing code style and structure.

Create new modules for:

Regions

Users (including authentication support)

In the root/data directory, you will find two files containing city and region data. Devise an efficient method to seed the database with this data.

ðŸŒŸ Bonus Challenge (Extra Points)
A file named users.json in data folder contains a list of usernames.

When a client (e.g., browser or mobile app) queries the server for users, your API should return:

The list of users.

The corresponding cities whose names start with the same first letter as the username.

This operation must be highly optimized and performant.
